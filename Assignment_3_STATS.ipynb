    "    Given that seasons are equally likely and all 4 seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall) occur at least once each among their birthdays\n",
    "\n",
    "    Total outcomes: Each person is allotted a season out of 4. Hence 48 possibilities\n",

    "    Using Inclusion and Exclusion, 4C1*38 - 4C2*28 + 4C3*18  [i.e. Exclude 1 season - Exclude 2 season + exclude 3 season, also note that we can't exclude all the 4 seasons]\n",

    "    (4C1*38 - 4C2*28 + 4C3*18  ) / 48 = 0.377\n",
